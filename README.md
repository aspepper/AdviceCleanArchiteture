## About the Template üîç
API of a to-do list system that offers a ***modern and scalable solution*** for managing personal tasks. Users can create, update, and delete lists (***CRUD***), as well as add and manipulate individual tasks.

The API architecture incorporates concepts such as ***CQRS***, ***Event Sourcing***, ***MediatR***, ***SAGA***, ***TDD***, ***DDD***, and ***Clean Code***, ensuring a solid and efficient structure.

The main goal is to provide users with an intuitive and effective experience for managing their daily activities.

<br>
<br>

<div id='keys'/>

## Key Concepts üîë
Below are explanations of the key concepts mentioned above that underpin the to-do list system API:

* ***<ins>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):***</ins> <br>
  It is an architectural pattern used in the API to separate read operations (***queries***) from write operations (***commands***). This allows ***better separation of concerns*** and ***performance optimization*** when dealing with different types of operations.

* ***<ins>Event Sourcing:***</ins> <br>
  The API uses the concept of events to ***notify*** and ***react to changes in the state of entities***. Events are emitted whenever a significant action occurs, such as ***creating a new to-do list*** or ***completing a task***. These events can be consumed by other system components to perform additional actions, such as sending notifications or updating other related entities.

* ***<ins>MediatR:***</ins> <br>
  It is a design pattern that enables ***communication*** and ***management of commands/queries and events*** among different components of the API. It facilitates the use of the CQRS pattern, allowing ***separation*** and ***proper handling of command/query and event requests***.

* ***<ins>SAGA Orchestration Pattern:***</ins> <br>
  Used to ***orchestrate*** and ***manage complex transactions*** and ***business processes*** involving multiple steps and components. In the API, SAGAs can be ***used to handle workflows involving multiple operations*** related to tasks and to-do lists, ensuring that these operations are executed ***consistently*** and ***reliably***.

* ***<ins>DDD (Domain-Driven Design):***</ins> <br>
  A software design approach that aims at ***efficient and cohesive modeling of the business domain***. The API follows DDD principles to organize entities, aggregates, services, and events in a clear and understandable domain structure, allowing for ***flexible and scalable design***.

* ***<ins>Clean Code:***</ins> <br>
  The API adopts Clean Code principles to promote ***readable***, ***concise***, and ***easily maintainable code***. This includes the use of meaningful naming for classes and methods, creating small and well-defined functions, eliminating code duplication, and adopting good programming practices.

* ***<ins>TDD (Test-Driven Development):***</ins> <br>
  A development approach that emphasizes ***creating unit tests*** before implementing the code. In the API, unit tests are used to ***verify the correctness*** and ***robustness of implemented features***. Tests ensure that the API is working as expected, providing ***greater reliability*** and ***facilitating code maintenance***.

<br>
<br>

<div id='default'/>

## Standards üîí
The API adopts the following standards:

* ***<ins>Document Standardization:***</ins> <br>
  The API uses masks, sizes, and regular expressions to format document-related fields in a standardized way. This ensures that documents are inserted and displayed in a standardized manner.

* ***<ins>Type, Date, and Number Standardization:***</ins> <br>
  It uses the ISO/GNT format to standardize types, dates, and numbers. Additionally, the UTC standard is used for storing dates and times, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

* ***<ins>Screen Template:***</ins> <br>
  The API provides templates for screens that include data validation, formatting, and other user interface-related functionalities. This helps ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for API users.

* ***<ins>API Template:***</ins> <br>
  The API uses standardized templates to ensure security, data validation, and other essential functionalities in its programming interfaces. This facilitates the development of new features and ensures API consistency.

* ***<ins>Database Access:***</ins> <br>
  EntityFramework is used to facilitate access and manipulation of data in the database. This allows efficient abstraction of database operations and improves development productivity.

* ***<ins>Log Handling:***</ins> <br>
  The API uses NLog for log and exception handling. This allows recording relevant information and identifying the origin of queries and operations performed in the API.

* ***<ins>Multi-language:***</ins> <br>
  Supports Portuguese, English, and Spanish languages, enabling application internationalization and catering to different audiences.

* ***<ins>LGPD (General Data Protection Law):***</ins> <br>
  The API complies with LGPD. It implements mechanisms to ensure data privacy and security, such as searching by name and document, which can be performed in parts, ensuring the protection of personal data.

<br>
<br>

          });

          // Requiring Bearer security for Swagger operations
          c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
